# Reunion

## Preparation

1. Fork this repository.
1. Clone your new repository to your local machine.
1. Run `bundle` from the command line.
1. Run `rake` from the command line.

## Synthesis

Included with your pull request, you must submit answers to the following questions:

* What do you think we were trying to get you to learn with this challenge?
Work with different classes and get them to communicate with and pass data back and forth. Use the refactor methods and practice hiding the delegate.
* Outline in words (at least 5-6 sentences) what your code is doing in order to solve this problem.
I created an activity class that deals with the participants and when I needed to call out the participant information I utilized having the shovel on activity and list activities method so you call the methods on the activities array.
* What was the most difficult portion of this for you?
Time, I didn't feel particularly stumped on any parts but sometimes couldn't figure out how I would iterate over a bigger piece of code. The nested collections.
* What came naturally to you?
I felt like knowing which object I was working with or how I needed to call it out is coming more naturally to me.






## Tasks

We're developing a small application to split expenses after a group of friends get together for a reunion. This will track how much each person spent on a particular activity, how much each person owes across all activities, and ultimately print out a summary of how much each person owes or is owed.

Use tests to drive your development.

### Iteration 1: Creating Activities

Add to the existing Activity class so that it supports the following functionality.

* An Activity has a name, such as 'hiking'  
* An Activity has participants
  * participants are represented with a hash and have a name and an amount they've paid for that activity  
* You can add participants to an Activity
* You can evaluate the total cost of an activity   

### Iteration 2: Activity Calculations

Add to the Activity class so that it supports the following functionality. Note, it is assumed that the cost of each activity is split evenly between all participants.

* You can split the cost of an activity
* You can evaluate out how much each person is owed/owes
  * If a participant paid less than their fair share they owe a positive amount.
  * If a participant paid more than their fair share they owe a negative amount (meaning they are owed money).  


### Iteration 3: Creating Reunions

Add to the existing Reunion class so that it supports the following functionality.

* A Reunion has a location
* A Reunion has Activities  
* You can add Activities to a Reunion

### Iteration 4: Reunion Calculations

Add to the existing Reunion class so that it supports the following functionality.

* You can evaluate the total cost of a Reunion
* You can create a total breakdown of the Reunion which figures out who owes/is owed how much
  * Consider all of the Activities
  * If a participant paid less than their fair share they owe a positive amount.
  * If a participant paid more than their fair share they owe a negative amount (meaning they are owed money).
* You can print a summary of total owed amounts per person


### Iteration 5: ERB

Research ERB. Create a template for a webpage using HTML and ERB that will display important details of a Reunion. Create a runner file to create a Reunion with Activities, and use the template to generate an HTML page that you can open in your browser.
